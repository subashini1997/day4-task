1.For the given JSON iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)
for:
The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, 
enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop.
for...in:
The for...in statement iterates over all enumerable properties of an object that are keyed by strings (ignoring ones keyed by Symbols), including inherited enumerable properties.
for...of:
The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables.
 It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object.
for each :
The similar but deprecated statement that iterates over the values of an object's properties, rather than the property names themselves


2.Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript
Window:
The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window. 
The window object is supported by all browsers. All global JavaScript objects , functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. 
The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser . This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
Document:
The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree. 
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. It is the root node of the HTML document. 
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. 
HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface, whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.
Screen:
Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions . It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc.
It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. It can be written without window prefix.
